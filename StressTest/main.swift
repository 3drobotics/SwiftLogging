/*
Leaky queue.

Originally adapted from my logging code that would log events in the background.

This code submits a lot (millions work "best") of closures to a serial queue.
Each submission consumes memory but the memory isn't freed even once the
closures have all been dequeued.

It leaks with SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL = -Owholemodule or -Ofast or -Onone

This code leaks when compiled with swift 2.2 or swift 3 (some minor syntax
adaptions needed).
It leaks as part of a OS X command line tool, OS X app or iOS app.
The memory is not cleaned up if I let it run after completing.
Sprinkling relevent code with autoreleasepool() doesn't affect memory usage
(more applicable with previous versions of this code).
Switch to dispatch_async_f and passing in a nil context _does_ (seem to) fix the
memory issues..
